The above code is a simple calculator application. We are using the Tkinter library to create a simple and seamless GUI. We used two input boxes: the first input box is used to take the first number, and the second input box is used to take the second number. After entering both numbers, the user will be given four choices and must pick one of the options. The four options are "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, "/" for division. When the user picks one of the above options, the respective operation will be performed on the numbers, and the result will be displayed. If an input box is left empty, a warning will be triggered, prompting the user to enter a number. Additionally, if the user tries to divide a number by zero, a warning will be triggered, stating that division by zero is not allowed.
